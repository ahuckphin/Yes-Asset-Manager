## New Backup Refurbishment Log vs New Restore Refurbishment Log
The reason for the existence of 2 different new log is because of adoption of the concept of disk imaging. You do all steps on 1 computer, image the disk and restore the image on another laptop allowing the skipping of many steps on the other laptop.  

## Limitations

* Refreshing page will resubmit the form. 

## My work is different. How can I edit the work list? 
There is unfortunatenly no front end interface to manipulate the work list. You will have to open `new-log-backup.php` and or `new-log-restore.php` file. Each work comprises of 2 lines of code. Example:
```
<input type="checkbox" name="work[]" value="Ubuntu Hostname set. ">
<label for="work[]">Ubuntu Hostname set. </label><br>
```
In this case, `Ubuntu Hostname set` is the work. You can use the template below to add your own work:
```
<input type="checkbox" name="work[]" value="INSERT_WORK_HERE ">
<label for="work[]">INSERT_WORK_HERE </label><br>
```
Replace `INSERT_WORK_HERE` with your own work. Do leave a space after the work for best results in database. 


## Database
The database this application links to is called "yesassetmanager" and comprises of 3 tables.

Create table SQL commands generated by `SHOW CREATE TABLE` command. 

Note that UserID coloumn currently not used. 

You will need to manually insert database location, username and password into each file individually during installation.
